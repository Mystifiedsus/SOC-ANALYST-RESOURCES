### Detecting Open Redirection Attacks

## What is Open Redirection?

Open redirection is a web security vulnerability that occurs when a website or web application redirects users to a different URL without proper validation or sanitization of the target URL. Attackers can exploit Open Redirection to trick users into visiting malicious websites or performing actions unintended by the website owner.

In an open redirection attack, an attacker typically crafts a legitimate URL hosted on the vulnerable website, but includes a malicious URL as a parameter or query string. When a user clicks on the crafted URL, the website's redirect mechanism automatically redirects the user to the malicious URL, which can lead to various malicious activities, such as phishing attacks, spreading malware, or stealing sensitive information.

Open redirection vulnerabilities commonly occur when websites use user-supplied input, such as URLs, as part of their redirect mechanism without proper validation or sanitization. To prevent open redirection attacks, web developers should validate and sanitize all user-supplied input used in redirections, and ensure that only trusted and whitelisted URLs are allowed for redirection. Additionally, it's important to implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authenticated and authorized users can perform redirects. Regular security testing, including vulnerability scanning and penetration testing, can also help identify and fix open redirection vulnerabilities in web applications.
## Open Redirection Types / Possible Vectors

There are several types of open redirection vulnerabilities that can occur in web applications. These include:

1. **URL-based open redirection:** This is the most common type of open redirection vulnerability. It occurs when a website takes a URL or a URL parameter as input and uses it in a redirect without proper validation or sanitization. An attacker can craft a malicious URL that includes a different domain or malicious URL as a parameter which will be included in the redirect, leading to an unintended redirection to a malicious website.
2. **JavaScript-based open redirection:** This type of open redirection vulnerability occurs when a website uses JavaScript to perform a redirect, but the target URL is obtained from untrusted or user-controlled sources without proper validation or sanitization. An attacker can manipulate the JavaScript code or input data to execute a malicious redirect to a different domain or URL.
3. **Meta refresh-based open redirection:** This type of open redirection vulnerability occurs when a website uses the HTML "meta refresh" tag to redirect users to another URL automatically, and the target URL is obtained from untrusted or user-controlled sources without proper validation or sanitization. An attacker can manipulate the meta refresh tag or input data to trigger a malicious redirect to a different domain or URL.
4. **Header-based open redirection:** This type of open redirection vulnerability occurs when a website uses HTTP headers, such as "Location" header, to perform a redirect, but the target URL is obtained from untrusted or user-controlled sources without proper validation or sanitization. An attacker can manipulate the header value or input data to trigger a malicious redirect to a different domain or URL.
5. **Parameter-based open redirection:** This type of open redirection vulnerability occurs when a website uses a parameter in the URL or in a form submission as part of the redirect process, but fails to properly validate or sanitize the parameter value. An attacker can manipulate the parameter value to trigger a redirect to a malicious URL.

It's important for web developers to be aware of these different types of open redirection vulnerabilities and implement proper validation and sanitization of user-supplied input to prevent such vulnerabilities in their web applications.

How Open Redirection Works?

Here's an example of a vulnerable code in a web application that demonstrates an open redirection vulnerability using PHP:

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Detecting-Web-Attacks-2/open+redirection/carbon+(1).png)

In this example, the web application takes a target URL as a query parameter (`url`) from the user and uses it in a redirect without validating or sanitizing the input. This can lead to an open redirection vulnerability, as an attacker can craft a malicious URL and pass it as the `url` parameter, leading to unintended redirection to a malicious website.

For example, an attacker could create a URL like this:

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Detecting-Web-Attacks-2/open+redirection/Bash+URL.png)

When a user clicks on this URL, the vulnerable application will automatically redirect the user to `http://malicious.com`, which could be a phishing website or a site hosting malware.
## Impact of Open Redirection

Open redirection vulnerabilities can have a significant impact on the security of a web application and its users. Some of the potential impacts of open redirection vulnerabilities include:

1. Phishing attacks: Attackers can craft malicious URLs that appear legitimate and trick users into clicking on them, leading to unintended redirection to a phishing website. Phishing attacks aim to steal sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, and financial details, from unsuspecting users.
2. Malware distribution: Attackers can redirect users to websites hosting malware, which can result in the automatic download and installation of malicious software on the user's device. This can lead to malware infections, data breaches, and other types of cyber attacks.
3. Social engineering attacks: Attackers can use open redirection vulnerabilities to conduct social engineering attacks, where they manipulate users into taking unintended actions, such as downloading malware, making fraudulent payments, or revealing sensitive information.
4. Reputation damage: If a website is found to have open redirection vulnerabilities, it can result in reputational damage for the website owner or organization. Users may lose trust in the website's security and reliability, leading to loss of business, brand damage, and financial repercussions.
5. Legal and regulatory consequences: Open redirection vulnerabilities can result in legal and regulatory consequences, especially if sensitive user information is compromised. Organizations may face legal liabilities, fines, or other penalties for failing to protect user data and secure their web applications.

Overall, open redirection vulnerabilities can have serious consequences, ranging from financial loss to reputational damage, and can pose a significant risk to the security and privacy of web application users. It is important for web developers to implement proper input validation and sanitization, as well as follow other web security best practices in order to prevent open redirection vulnerabilities and protect their applications and users from potential harm.
## Prevention Methods for Open Redirection

Actually, this issue was briefly mentioned above, but if we give a more detailed explanation; to prevent open redirection vulnerabilities in web applications, web developers should follow secure coding practices and implement proper input validation and sanitization techniques. Here are some preventive measures that can be taken:

**Validate and sanitize input:** Always validate and sanitize any user-supplied input that is used in the redirection process. This includes URL parameters, form submissions, and any other input that is used in generating redirect URLs. Validate that the input conforms to expected formats, such as valid URLs or whitelisted domains, and sanitize it to remove any malicious or unexpected characters.

**Use a whitelist approach:** Instead of trying to blacklist or filter out specific characters or patterns from user input, it's generally safer to use a whitelist approach where only known and trusted values are allowed. Define a whitelist of trusted domains or URLs to which the application is allowed to redirect, and validate that the user-supplied input matches the whitelist.

**Avoid using user-controlled data in redirects:** Avoid using user-controlled data, such as input from URL parameters or form submissions, directly in the redirect process. If possible, use other means of redirection, such as using HTTP headers or server-side redirects that do not rely on user-controlled data.

**Implement proper authorization and authentication:** Ensure that only authorized users are allowed to trigger redirects. Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms to verify the legitimacy of the user and their actions.

**Implement secure coding practices:** Follow secure coding practices, such as using secure coding libraries or frameworks, keeping software up-to-date with the latest security patches, and conducting regular security reviews and vulnerability assessments.

**Educate users about potential risks:** Educate users about the potential risks of clicking on suspicious or unexpected URLs, and encourage them to be cautious when clicking on links from unknown sources or providing personal information on websites.

**Stay informed about web security best practices:** Stay updated with the latest web security best practices and guidelines, such as the OWASP Top Ten Project, and incorporate them into your development processes.

By implementing these preventive measures and following secure coding practices, web developers can significantly reduce the risk of open redirection vulnerabilities in their web applications and protect their users from potential attacks. Regular security testing, including penetration testing and vulnerability assessments, can also help identify and mitigate any potential vulnerabilities in the application.

Here's an example of a vulnerable code in PHP that demonstrates an open redirection vulnerability, along with a fixed version:

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Detecting-Web-Attacks-2/open+redirection/Example+Vulnerable.png)

Fixed Code:

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Detecting-Web-Attacks-2/open+redirection/Example+Fixed.png)

In the fixed version, the `**filter_var`** function with `**FILTER_VALIDATE_URL`** filter is used to validate the user-supplied **`url`** parameter. This filter checks if the value is a valid URL according to the PHP filter extension, and if it returns **`true`**, the redirect is performed to the validated URL. If the **`url`** parameter does not pass the validation, a default URL or an error message can be shown, and no redirection is performed. This helps to prevent malicious URLs or invalid values from being used in the redirection process, mitigating the open redirection vulnerability.
## Detecting Open Redirect Attacks

What was described in Part 1 was a list of things to do from the perspective of a hacker/attacker. At the same time, the issues that a developer should pay attention to while developing were also mentioned.

So in this part, let’s have a look at how to detect Open Redirection attacks with an example. But, before moving, let’s quickly recap some of the important things to detect Open Redirection attacks;

1. If there is a consecutive requests to query string parameters such as ?next (http://website.com/param.php?next=), or ?url ( http://website.com/…?url=), with payloads like http://attacker.com or attacker.com (URL structure)
2. For the WAF or other middleware products, sometimes payloads can have bypass techniques like;
    1. Localhost
        1. http://[::]:25/
        2. http://①②⑦.⓪.⓪.⓪
    2. CDIR
        1. http://127.0.0.0
    3. Decimal Bypass
        1. http://2130706433/ = http://127.0.0.1
    4. Hexadecimal Bypass
        1. http://0x7f000001/ = http://127.0.0.1
3. Encoded characters like %2f = /

Of course it’s not possible to detect or analyze web server logs without using automated detection methods. For an easier way, any SOC analyst can use the following regex to detect open redirection attacks. 

/^.*"GET.*\?.*=(https%3a%2f%2f[a-z0-9-]+%2e[a-z]{2,}).+?.*HTTP\/.*".*$/gm

This regex will match any log entry where the HTTP method is GET, the request contains a query parameter with https://x.com, and the request is using HTTP version 1.0 or 1.1. This should match the most common open redirection attack patterns.

You can customize this regex to match specific query parameters or HTTP methods that are relevant to your web application. Remember that this regex is just one part of an overall security monitoring strategy and should be used in conjunction with other security tools and best practices.

Detection Example

Example nginx access log file;

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Detecting-Web-Attacks-2/open+redirection/Access+Log.png)

As you can see it on the above screenshot, open redirection attacks were made to the http://victim.com website on 18/Apr/2023:20:05:05. We have mentioned that attention should be to encoded characters. Here is where the importance of this issue is seen.

**Encoded:**

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Detecting-Web-Attacks-2/open+redirection/encoded-open.png)

**Decoded:**

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Detecting-Web-Attacks-2/open+redirection/decoded-open.png)

When we decode the request, we see that the attacker wants to redirect to google.com with the ?pro parameter. When we realize that all requests occur within seconds, we understand that this is done with the help of a tool. At the same time, the source IPs are all the same.

In this lesson, we have covered the Open redirection attack. We have talked about how the vulnerability appears, as well as its detection and prevention methods.

### Detecting Directory Traversal Attacks

## What is Directory Traversal?

Directory traversal is an attack type that the attackers leverage often to access files and directories that are stored outside the web server's root directory. It involves manipulating input to be able to access files on a web server that are actually not intended to be accessible by unauthorized users. This type of attack is also known as the "dot-dot-slash" attack, and it can be used to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or execute arbitrary code on a web server.

For example, let's say a web application uses the following URL to display user profile pictures:

[http://example.com/profiles/picture.php?name=user1.jpg](http://example.com/profiles/picture.php?name=user1.jpg)

An attacker can leverage directory traversal attack to access files outside of the intended directory by adding ../ to the URL. For instance, they could use the following URL to access a file outside of the profiles directory: [http://example.com/profiles/picture.php?name=../../etc/passwd](http://example.com/profiles/picture.php?name=../../etc/passwd)

This would give the attacker access to sensitive system files, such as the password file.

Actually, at first look, it’s pretty similar to a Local File Inclusion vulnerability. The main difference between the directory traversal and LFI is the source of the input. Directory traversal involves in manipulating the input that is used to access files on a web server, whereas LFI involves in manipulating input that is used to include local files within a web application.

In a local file inclusion vulnerability, an attacker can use user input to include a file from the local file system into the web application. This can allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server to access the sensitive data.

For example, consider a web application that includes a file based on user input, such as **include($_GET['page']).** An attacker could manipulate the **page** parameter to include a sensitive file on the server, such as **../../../../etc/passwd**. This would allow the attacker to read the password file and gain unauthorized access to the system.

In contrast, directory traversal vulnerabilities allow attackers to access files outside of the web application's root directory. This can also allow them to execute arbitrary code or access sensitive data, but the attack vector is different.
## Directory Traversal Possible Vectors

Directory traversal attacks can occur through various attack vectors, including:

1. **User input:** Attackers can manipulate user input parameters, such as URLs, file paths, and form fields, to access files outside of the intended directory. This can be done by adding "../" or other special characters to the input.
2. **Cookies:** If a web application stores user data in cookies, attackers can try to manipulate the cookie value to access files outside of the intended directory.
3. **HTTP headers:** Attackers can manipulate HTTP headers, such as the Referer or User-Agent header, to access files outside of the intended directory.
4. **File upload:** If a web application allows file uploads, attackers can upload malicious files that contain directory traversal attacks.
5. **Direct requests:** Attackers can try to access files and directories directly by guessing or brute-forcing the file names or paths.
6. **URL manipulation:** Attackers can try to manipulate the URL of a web application to access files outside of the intended directory. For example, they can add "/../" to the URL to go up one directory level.
7. **Malicious links:** Attackers can send users malicious links that contain directory traversal attacks. When the user clicks on the link, the attack is executed on their computer.

How Directory Traversal Works?

Here's an example of vulnerable code that is susceptible to directory traversal attacks in a PHP script:

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Detecting-Web-Attacks-2/directory+traversal/img1.png)

In this example, the script takes a file name as a parameter from the user input using the **$_GET** method. The script then concatenates the user input with the document root directory to form a full path to the file.

However, this code is vulnerable to directory traversal attacks since an attacker can manipulate the **file** parameter to include **../** characters, which will allow them to access files outside of the intended directory. For example, an attacker could use the following URL to access the **/etc/passwd** file on the server:

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Detecting-Web-Attacks-2/directory+traversal/img2.png)
## Impact of Directory Traversal

The impact of a directory traversal attack can be severe, depending on the files and directories that the attacker can access.

Attackers who successfully exploits a directory traversal vulnerability can view, modify, or delete files that they are not authorized to access. This can lead to a variety of security risks and attacks, including:

1. **Disclosure of sensitive data:** An attacker can access sensitive files, such as password files, configuration files, and user data, which can be used for identity theft, fraud, or other malicious activities.
2. **Execution of arbitrary code:** An attacker can upload and execute malicious files that contain commands or code that can harm the system, such as malware or backdoors.
3. **Denial of service:** An attacker can delete critical files or cause a system to crash, resulting in a denial of service attack.
4. **System compromise:** An attacker who gains access to system files or directories can use this access to escalate privileges, install rootkits, or take control of the entire system.
## Prevention Methods for Directory Traversal Attacks

Here are some best practices to prevent directory traversal attacks in web applications:

**Input validation and sanitization:** Validate and sanitize all user input, especially the file paths and the directory names. This can involve using regular expressions or other methods to check the input for valid characters, and to limit the input to known values or directories.

**Access controls:** Limit the web server's access to only the files and directories required for the application to function. Use file the system permissions and access controls to restrict access to sensitive files and directories.

**Relative file paths:** Use relative file paths instead of absolute paths whenever possible. This can prevent attackers from using the "../" character to navigate up to higher-level directories.

**Whitelisting:** Use a whitelist approach where only specific characters are allowed in the file name parameter. This can be done using a validation library or a custom validation function.

**Secure coding practices:** Use secure coding practices, such as avoiding the use of user input directly in file path concatenation, using secure file upload mechanisms, and avoiding the use of insecure functions like eval() and system().

**Web application firewall:** Use a web application firewall (WAF) to detect and block directory traversal attacks. WAFs can analyze incoming traffic for malicious requests and prevent attacks from reaching the web application.

By following these best practices, web application developers and administrators can reduce the risk of directory traversal attacks and protect their web applications and systems from unauthorized access and data breaches.

Here's an example of vulnerable PHP code that is susceptible to directory traversal attacks:

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Detecting-Web-Attacks-2/directory+traversal/img3.png)

In this code, the **$file** variable is set to the value of the **file** parameter from the user's input. The script then concatenates this value with the document root directory to form a full file path in the **$full_path** variable. This code is vulnerable to directory traversal attacks because an attacker can include directory traversal sequences like **../** in the **file** parameter to access files outside of the intended directory.

Here's an updated version of the code that uses input validation and sanitization to prevent directory traversal attacks:

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Detecting-Web-Attacks-2/directory+traversal/img4.png)

In this updated version of the code, we first validate the input using a regular expression to ensure that the file name only contains alphanumeric characters, underscores, and hyphens. We then use the **realpath()** function to get the absolute path of the file and check that the resulting path is within the document root directory. This prevents the use of directory traversal sequences like **../** to access files outside of the intended directory. If the file exists, we read and output its contents; otherwise, we output an error message.
## Detecting Directory Traversal Attacks

In Part 1, we have overviewed what the directory traversal attack is and how to prevent this attack type. In this part, we’ll have a look at detection techniques and some tips to make it easier. Before the moving on, let’s have a quick look for example payloads for the directory traversal vulnerability;

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Detecting-Web-Attacks-2/directory+traversal/img5.png)

These are really basic payloads for directory traversal attacks. So, we should keep in mind ../ (dot dot slash), encoded and double encoded ../ is the key values for this attack type. Here is the basic example for detecting these payloads on nginx access.log file;

/^.*"GET.*\?.*=(%2e%2e%2f).+?.*HTTP\/.*".*$/gm

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Detecting-Web-Attacks-2/directory+traversal/img6.png)

As a bypass technique, attackers may also use unicode encode characters to bypass WAF or any other product.

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Detecting-Web-Attacks-2/directory+traversal/img7.png)

In that case, Nginx access log will be like;

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Detecting-Web-Attacks-2/directory+traversal/img8.png)

These are detection payloads for the Directory Traversal attack. For a successful exploit, attacker needs to access some files. most popular ones are;

```
**Linux**

/etc/issue

/etc/passwd

/etc/shadow

/etc/group

/etc/hosts
```

```
**Windows**

c:/boot.ini

c:/inetpub/logs/logfiles

c:/inetpub/wwwroot/global.asa

c:/inetpub/wwwroot/index.asp

c:/inetpub/wwwroot/web.config

c:/sysprep.inf
```

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Detecting-Web-Attacks-2/directory+traversal/directory-log.png)

Basic regex that we have shared above will work with these logs but to prevent False Positive alarms it can be updated more strictly like;

```
/^.*"GET.*\?.*=(.+?(?=%2e%2e%2fetc%2f)).+?.*HTTP\/.*".*$/gm
```

In this lesson, we have covered the Directory Traversal attack. We have talked about how this attack appears, as well as its detection and prevention methods.

### Detecting Brute Force Attacks

## What is Brute Forcing?

Brute forcing is a type of attack that involves attempting to guess a password or authentication token by systematically trying every possible combination of characters until the correct one is found. In the context of web attacks, brute forcing typically refers to the process of using automated tools to repeatedly submit login requests to a web application using different username and password combinations until a valid one is discovered.

Brute force attacks can be used to gain unauthorized access to a system, steal sensitive information, or launch further attacks against the target or other systems. They can be particularly effective against weak or poorly protected passwords, but can also be very time-consuming and resource-intensive for the attacker, especially if the target system has implemented measures to detect and block brute force attacks.

Brute force attacks are one of the simplest and most straightforward methods of attacking a web application, and it works by systematically trying every possible combination of usernames and passwords until the correct one is found. This process is typically automated using specialized software or scripts, which can try thousands or even millions of combinations per second.

The basic idea behind a brute force attack is to exploit the weak or easily guessable passwords that a lot of people use especially the non-techy users, such as common dictionary words, simple number sequences, or their own names or birthdates. By systematically trying every possible combination of characters, attackers can eventually find the correct password and gain access to the target system.
## Brute Forcing Possible Vectors

Brute forcing on web applications is a common attack vector used by hackers to gain unauthorized access to user accounts or web servers. In this type of attack, the attacker will use automated tools to submit multiple login requests to the targeted web application using different usernames and passwords, in an attempt to find the correct credentials and gain access to the system.

Web applications are particularly vulnerable to brute force attacks because they are often accessible over the internet and rely on user authentication to control access to sensitive data or functionality. If an attacker is able to guess a valid username and password, they can potentially gain access to sensitive user data, such as financial information, personal data, or confidential business information. 

Actually, it’s not just guessing usernames and passwords also, directory brute forcing on web applications is another type of brute force attack that involves guessing file or directory names on a web server in order to find hidden or sensitive files or directories. In this type of attack, the attacker will use automated tools to submit requests to the targeted web server using different file or directory names, in an attempt to find files or directories that are not meant to be publicly accessible.

This type of attack can be effective against web applications that do not implement proper access controls or that have poorly configured web servers. To prevent directory brute force attacks, web application developers can implement access controls to restrict access to sensitive files and directories, and can configure their web servers to block requests for known sensitive files and directories.
## How Brute Forcing Works?

Here's an example of vulnerable code that is susceptible to Brute Forcing attacks in a PHP script:

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Detecting-Web-Attacks-2/brute+force/img1.png)

This form is vulnerable to brute force attacks because it allows unlimited login attempts and does not implement any security measures to prevent automated login attempts.

Here's an example of how you can use Python requests library to send multiple login requests with a list of usernames and passwords:

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Detecting-Web-Attacks-2/brute+force/img2.png)
## Impact of Brute Forcing

Brute forcing can have significant impacts on a target system or application. Here are some of the potential impacts of brute forcing:

1. **Denial of service:** Brute forcing can consume a significant amount of computing resources, such as CPU cycles and memory, which can lead to system slowdowns or crashes. This can cause a denial of service (DoS) attack, which makes the target system unavailable to legitimate users.

2. **Data leakage:** Successful brute force attacks can allow unauthorized access to sensitive data, such as login credentials, personal information, financial data, and intellectual property. This can lead to data breaches, which can have severe consequences for the target organization, including financial losses and damage to reputation.

3. **Account takeover:** Brute forcing can allow attackers to gain access to user accounts without the owner's consent. Once an attacker has access to an account, they can carry out malicious activities, such as stealing data, sending spam, or carrying out further attacks.

4. **Password reuse:** Brute forcing can reveal weak or easily guessable passwords, which can encourage users to reuse passwords across multiple accounts. This can increase the risk of compromise, as a successful brute force attack on one account can provide access to multiple accounts.

5. **Legal and reputational consequences:** Brute forcing is illegal and unethical, and can result in significant legal and reputational consequences for individuals and organizations who engage in it. If caught, attackers can face criminal charges, fines, and other penalties. Additionally, organizations who are victims of brute force attacks may suffer reputational damage, loss of trust from customers and stakeholders, and legal liability for failing to protect their systems and data.
## Prevention Methods for Brute Forcing

Implement account lockout policies: After a certain number of failed login attempts, lock the user account for a specified period of time, to prevent further login attempts. This will make brute force attacks more difficult, as the attacker will need to wait for the account to become unlocked before attempting more login attempts.

**Implement CAPTCHA:** Use CAPTCHA or other bot detection mechanisms to detect automated login attempts and prevent them from succeeding.

**Limit the rate of login attempts:** Implement a mechanism that limits the number of login attempts that can be made within a certain time period (e.g. 5 login attempts per minute). This will slow down brute force attacks, as the attacker will need to wait between attempts.

**Use multi-factor authentication:** Require users to provide additional authentication factors, such as a one-time code sent via SMS or email, in addition to their username and password.

**Monitoring login attempts:** This involves monitoring login attempts for signs of suspicious activity, such as multiple failed login attempts from the same IP address, or unusual spikes in traffic or requests. This can help to detect and prevent brute force attacks before they are successful.

**Using strong passwords and password policies:** This involves requiring users to choose strong passwords that are difficult to guess, and enforcing password policies that require users to change their passwords regularly and prohibiting the use of weak or easily guessable passwords.

Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) are commonly used to protect web applications from various types of attacks, including brute force attacks. Here are some ways WAFs can prevent brute force attacks; 

IP blocking: WAFs can block access to the web application from IP addresses that have made excessive login attempts or have triggered other security rules. This can prevent brute force attacks by blocking the attacker's access to the application altogether.

User behavior analysis: WAFs can analyze user behavior patterns to detect abnormal activity, such as a high rate of login attempts or unusual login times. This can help prevent brute force attacks by detecting and blocking suspicious behavior before it becomes a problem.

It's important to note that WAFs are not foolproof and can be bypassed by skilled attackers. Therefore, it's important to implement multiple layers of security controls, such as strong passwords, account lockout policies, and security awareness trainings for users, in addition to using  WAFs.

By implementing these measures, the login form can be more secure, robust, and resistant to brute-force attacks.
## Detecting Brute Forcing Attacks

In Part 1, we have described what the Brute Forcing is and how to prevent this attack type. In this part, we’ll have a look at the detection techniques and some tips to make it easier to detect and prevent brute force attacks.

Analyzing brute force attacks can help you understand the methods used by attackers and identify vulnerabilities in your security controls. To do this, you should **collect and store** authentication logs from your web application, including the successful logins as well as the failed login attempts. Look for **patterns of suspicious activity** in the authentication logs, such as a high number of failed login attempts from a **particular IP address** or user account. **Analyze network traffic logs** to identify patterns of traffic that may be associated with brute force attacks, such as repeated login attempts from the same IP address or requests to non-existent pages or directories. 

Deploy an **intrusion detection system (IDS) or intrusion prevention system (IPS)** to analyze network traffic and detect signs of brute force attacks. **Look for common attack vectors** used in brute force attacks, such as dictionary attacks or password spraying. Identify user accounts that are vulnerable to brute force attacks due to weak passwords or other vulnerabilities. Finally, monitor for incidents of brute force attacks and respond to them promptly **by blocking malicious IP addresses**, locking out user accounts, and implementing additional security controls as necessary. By following these steps, you can strengthen your security controls and reduce the risk of successful brute force attacks.

Example Nginx log file that contains Brute Force attack;

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Detecting-Web-Attacks-2/brute+force/img3.png)

The log file provided shows the unsuccessful login attempts only. In order to detect the successful login attempts, you would need to analyze the logs further or modify your logging configuration to include the successful login attempts as well.

Successful login attempts would typically result in a response code of 200 or a redirect to a different page, which can be identified in the log file. However, keep in mind that some attackers may attempt to obfuscate their successful login attempts by logging in with valid credentials or using a compromised account, so it is important to perform further analysis to determine if any suspicious activity is occurring.

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Detecting-Web-Attacks-2/brute+force/img4.png)

In this example, the log entry shows a POST request to the **/login.php** page with a response code of **302**, which indicates a successful login attempt. The **Cookie** header also includes a **PHPSESSID** value and a login value, which may be used to track the user session and authentication status. Note that the exact format and contents of the log files can vary depending on the web server and its configuration.

To detect brute force attacks in nginx log files, you can use various tools and techniques such as:

**Log analysis tools:** There are several log analysis tools such as Logstash, ElasticSearch, and Kibana (ELK Stack) that can help you analyze nginx log files and detect brute force attacks. These tools will allow you to search for specific patterns in the log files, such as repeated failed login attempts from the same IP address or user agent.

**Regular expressions:** Regular expressions can be used to search for specific patterns in the log files. For example, you can use a regular expression to match a sequence of repeated failed login attempts from the same IP address or user agent.

**_Things that you can do after the detection:_**

**Fail2ban:** Fail2ban is a popular intrusion prevention tool that can be used to automatically block the IP addresses that are detected as engaging in brute force attacks. Fail2ban works by monitoring the nginx log files and applying predefined filters to detect and block suspicious activity.

**IP blocking:** You can manually block IP addresses that are detected as engaging in brute force attacks by adding them to the nginx configuration file. For example, you can use the deny rule to block traffic from specific IP addresses:

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Detecting-Web-Attacks-2/brute+force/img5.png)

It's important to note that detecting brute force attacks is not always a straightforward process and may require additional analysis and investigation to identify the suspicious activity accurately.

Here's an example of a regular expression that can be used to detect repeated failed login attempts from the same IP address in an nginx log file:

/^(\S+) \S+ \S+ \[.*?\] "(POST|GET) \/login\.php.*?" (401|403) \d+ ".*?" ".*?"/gm

This regular expression will match any log file entry that includes a failed login attempt **(401 or 403 status code)** to the **/login.php** page. It will capture the IP address of the client making the request in the first capture group **((\S+))**. You can then use a log analysis tool or script to count the number of times each IP address appears in the log file and flag any IP addresses that have a high number of failed login attempts as potential brute force attackers. Also, you can update the regex’s IP address as suspicious IP source.

In this lesson, we have covered the Brute Forcing attack. We have talked about how the vulnerability appears, as well as the detection and the prevention methods.

### Detecting XML External Entity Attacks

## What is XML External Entity?

For a better understanding let’s quickly look at what XML is.

XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a markup language that is used for structuring and storing data in a structured format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. XML was developed as a successor to HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and is widely used for data exchange between different systems and platforms, particularly on the web.

XML uses a set of tags to define the structure and content of the data being represented. These tags are used to identify and describe various elements and attributes of the data, such as tags for opening and closing elements, attributes for specifying additional information about the element, and entities for representing special characters and symbols.

One of the key advantages of XML is its flexibility and extensibility. It is possible to define custom tags and schemas for representing data, making it a powerful tool for representing complex data structures and exchanging data between different systems.

While XML was once widely used for a variety of purposes, its usage has declined in recent years as newer data formats like JSON have gained popularity with its simplicity, ease of use, and better support for modern web technologies.

XXE (XML External Entity) vulnerability is a type of security vulnerability that affects applications that parse XML input. In an XXE attack, an attacker injects malicious XML data into an application that uses an XML parser without proper validation, which can result in the application processing external entities that can be controlled by the attacker.

An external entity is a piece of XML that is defined outside of the XML document, but can be referenced and included within the document. An attacker can exploit an XXE vulnerability to include malicious external entities that can read local files, access internal systems, or perform other malicious actions on the server.

XXE vulnerabilities can be exploited in various ways, such as through web forms that accept XML input, SOAP and REST APIs that use XML-based payloads, or other applications that accept and process XML input. These attacks can lead to sensitive data leaks, server-side request forgery (SSRF), denial of service (DoS) attacks, and other serious security issues.

It is important for developers to be aware of XXE vulnerabilities and take steps to prevent them, such as disabling external entities, validating and sanitizing XML input, and using secure XML parsers that are specifically designed to prevent XXE attacks.
## XML External Entity Possible Vectors

To find XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerabilities in a web application, you can start by examining the application's XML processing code to identify any input points that accept XML input. These input points could include:

1. Form fields that accept XML input
2. XML files uploaded by users
3. APIs that accept XML requests
4. XML files used for configuration or other purposes

Once you have identified the input points that accept XML input, you can test them for XXE vulnerabilities by providing input that includes external entity references and observing the application's response.

You can also use automated vulnerability scanners and penetration testing tools that can detect and exploit XXE vulnerabilities. These tools can send various payloads that include external entity references and observe the response to determine if the application is vulnerable.
## How XML External Entity Works?

XXE attacks can depend on the programming language used by the server-side application. The XXE attack vector exploits a vulnerability in the XML parser of the server-side application, and the specific vulnerabilities and defenses can vary depending on the programming language used.

For example, PHP has a built-in XML parser called DOMDocument that is often used in web applications. The parser can be vulnerable to XXE attacks if the XML input is not properly validated and sanitized, and external entities are not disabled. As a defense, developers can use the libxml_disable_entity_loader() function to disable the loading of external entities in PHP.

Here's an example of vulnerable PHP code that demonstrates an XXE vulnerability:

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Detecting-Web-Attacks-2/xxe/img1.png)

In this example, the PHP script accepts an XML input parameter named "xml" and uses the loadXML() method of the DOMDocument class to parse it into a DOMDocument object. However, the code does not properly validate or sanitize the XML input, which can allow an attacker to inject an external entity and perform a variety of malicious actions.

An attacker could send the following XML input to exploit the XXE vulnerability: 

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Detecting-Web-Attacks-2/xxe/img2.png)

In this XML input, the attacker defines a new external entity called "xxe" that references the "/etc/passwd" file on the server. When the PHP script processes this input, it will load the "/etc/passwd" file and include its contents in the output, which can allow the attacker to read sensitive information from the server.

To prevent XXE attacks in PHP, it is important to validate and sanitize any XML input properly and disable the processing of external entities whenever possible. You can use the libxml_disable_entity_loader() function to disable the loading of external entities in PHP. Additionally, you can use input validation and sanitization functions such as filter_var() to ensure that the XML input is properly formatted and does not contain any malicious payloads.

Let’s take a look at how XXE vulnerability appears in Java servlet applications;

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Detecting-Web-Attacks-2/xxe/img3.png)

In this example, the servlet accepts an XML input parameter named "xml" and uses a DocumentBuilder object to parse it into a Document object. However, the code does not properly validate or sanitize the XML input, which can allow an attacker to inject an external entity and perform a variety of malicious actions.

An attacker could send the following XML input to exploit the XXE vulnerability:

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Detecting-Web-Attacks-2/xxe/img4.png)

In this payload, we define an external entity xxe that points to a remote XML file **http://attacker.com/xxe.xml**. Then, we include the entity within the **<data>** element using the &xxe; syntax.

When the XML parser processes this payload, it will attempt to fetch the remote xxe.xml file specified in the xxe entity. If the server hosting the vulnerable application is vulnerable to SSRF, this can result in the attacker being able to access internal systems or perform other malicious actions on the server.

## Impact of XML External Entity

The impact of an XXE vulnerability can vary depending on the specific vulnerability and the context of the application. In general, however, an XXE vulnerability can be quite serious and can result in a range of harmful outcomes, including:

1. **Information disclosure:** An attacker can use an XXE vulnerability to access sensitive data from the server with read/write capability that will allow the attacker to modify/transfer the data, such as configuration files, user credentials, and other sensitive information.
2. **Server-side request forgery (SSRF):** An attacker can use an XXE vulnerability to make requests on behalf of the server, allowing them to scan internal networks, exploit other vulnerabilities, and carry out further attacks.
3. **Denial of service (DoS):** An attacker can use an XXE vulnerability to launch a DoS attack by sending an XML input that causes the server to consume excessive resources, such as memory or CPU time.
4. **Remote code execution (RCE):** In some cases, an attacker can use an XXE vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the server, allowing them to take full control of the server and carry out further attacks.

Therefore, it is important to identify and remediate XXE vulnerabilities in web applications to prevent these and other harmful outcomes. Best practices for preventing XXE attacks include properly validating and sanitizing all XML input, disabling the processing of external entities, and using the latest secure versions of XML parsers and frameworks.

## Prevention Methods for XML External Entity

There are several best practices that can help prevent XXE attacks:

**Disable external entities:** One of the most effective ways to prevent XXE attacks is to disable the processing of external entities in the XML parser configuration. This can be done by setting the appropriate parser configuration or using a secure XML parser that has external entity processing disabled by default.

**Input validation and sanitization:** Always validate and sanitize all XML input before parsing it. This includes checking for malicious input such as nested XML entities, XML injections, and other forms of malicious input.

**Use secure parsers:** Use the latest version of a secure XML parser that has been specifically designed to prevent XXE attacks. These parsers have features that can help detect and prevent XXE attacks.

**Use whitelist filtering:** Implementing a whitelist of allowed entities and DTDs can help reduce the risk of XXE attacks by blocking any input that is not on the whitelist.

**Implement access controls:** Implement proper access controls to restrict access to sensitive data and resources. This can help limit the damage in case an XXE vulnerability is exploited.

**Use secure coding practices:** Use secure coding practices, such as input validation, data sanitization, and error handling, to minimize the risk of XXE attacks.

By implementing these best practices, you can significantly reduce the risk of XXE attacks in your web application. It is important to keep up-to-date with the latest security best practices and patches for your web application, and to periodically perform security assessments to identify and remediate any vulnerabilities.

Here's an example of vulnerable PHP code that is susceptible to XML External Entity attacks:

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Detecting-Web-Attacks-2/xxe/img5.png)

The code above loads an XML input from the **php://input** stream and passes it directly to the **loadXML()** method of the **DOMDocument** class without any validation or sanitization. This makes it vulnerable to XXE attacks.

To fix this vulnerability, we need to validate and sanitize the XML input and disable external entities. Here is an example of a fixed version of the code:

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Detecting-Web-Attacks-2/xxe/img6.png)

In the code above, we have disabled external entities using the function **libxml_disable_entity_loader()**, which prevents XXE attacks. We have then validated and sanitized the XML input using a regular expression that only allows alphanumeric and underscore characters. If the input passes validation, we load it into the **DOMDocument** object and output the sanitized XML. If the input fails validation, we output an error message.

This fixed code ensures that the XML input is properly validated, sanitized, and processed securely, and is much less vulnerable to XXE attacks.

## Detecting XML External Entity Attacks

In Part 1, we have overviewed what the XML External Entity is and how to prevent this vulnerability. In this part, we’ll have a look at the detection techniques and some tips to make it easier. Before moving on let’s take a quick look for example payloads for the XML External Entity vulnerability;

**Basic XXE Payload**

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Detecting-Web-Attacks-2/xxe/img7.png)

**Blind XXE Payload**

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Detecting-Web-Attacks-2/xxe/img8.png)

**XXE Payload with PHP Filter**

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Detecting-Web-Attacks-2/xxe/img9.png)

Here's an example of what an Nginx log might look like when an XXE attack occurs via a vulnerable parameter on a GET request (This methodology is the same as analyzing POST requests):

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Detecting-Web-Attacks-2/xxe/img10.png)

In this log, the IP address of the client making the request is 123.45.67.89. The request was a GET request to the processXML endpoint, with an xml parameter that contains an XXE payload. The XXE payload attempts to read the contents of the /etc/passwd file. The response code is 200, indicating that the request was successful, and the response size is 143 bytes. The user agent string indicates that the request was made from a Chrome browser on a Windows 10 machine.

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Detecting-Web-Attacks-2/xxe/img11.png)

The most important things to detect XXE attacks on the logs, you should check specific keyword like;

- DOCTYPE
- ELEMENT
- ENTITY

So for the detecting !DOCTYPE keyword in nginx logs, we can use regex like;

^(\S+) - (\S+) \[(.*?)\] "(\S+) (.*?)\?(?=.*?\b21DOCTYPE\b).*? HTTP\/\d\.\d" (\d+) (\d+) "(.*?)" "(.*?)"

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Detecting-Web-Attacks-2/xxe/img12.png)

21 is for the encoded version of the ! character. Because !DOCTYPE is equal to %21DOCTYPE. This regex will match the following line on the example that we have shared above;

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Detecting-Web-Attacks-2/xxe/img13.png)

And decoded versions are;

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Detecting-Web-Attacks-2/xxe/img14.png)

So, it can be clearly seen that the user sends to XXE payload from source IP 123.45.67.89 on dates 30/Apr/2023:12:34:57 and 30/Apr/2023:12:34:59. 

In this lesson, we have covered the XML External Entity attack. We have talked about how the vulnerability appears, as well as its detection and prevention methods.
