### Introductory Information About MITRE Course

Cyber attackers have been performing cyber attacks on systems using the attack vectors of the time since digital systems existed. In the past, cyber attacks consisted of simple and understandable attack methods, as there were no complex and large digital systems. But over time, digital systems have grown and evolved into more complex digital structures, so cyber attacks have also become more difficult to understand with advanced methods. This also makes it difficult the detection of cyber attacks. Today, in order to fully understand a cyber attack, it is necessary to model the steps and details of cyber attacks in a way that is suitable for certain groups. One of the important frameworks that meet this modeling need is the MITRE ATT&CK framework.  
  
In this training, MITRE ATT&CK Framework, an important structure for SOC analysts will be covered. This is an entry level training that consists mainly of theoretical knowledge. SOC candidates will have a thorough knowledge of the MITRE ATT&CK Framework at the end of the training and are recommended to complete the topics in this training without skipping any parts.

### Introduction to MITRE

## **What is MITRE?**

MITRE was founded in 1958 in the USA as an organization that produces innovative solutions to advance national security in new ways and serve the public interest as an independent adviser. MITRE’s areas of work are Cybersecurity, Aerospace, AI & Machine Learning, Aviation & Transportation, Defense & Intelligence, Government Innovation, Health, Homeland Security and Telecom.

## **What is MITRE ATT&CK Framework?**

MITRE ATT&CK that stands for Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge is the framework of a knowledge database that was introduced by MITRE in 2013 and has been continuously developed and expanded along with the technology. It is possible to analyze cyber attacks systematically through the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Cyber attacks can be divided into certain stages and the methods used in each stage can be analyzed in depth and used in studies related to cyber security. The MITRE ATT&CK Framework is an essential resource for each and every employee in the cybersecurity industry.

## **Why is the MITRE ATT&CK Framework important to SOC Analyst?**

Since each step of cyber attacks is covered in detail in the MITRE ATT&CK Framework, SOC Analysts can clearly see the actions that should be taken for each stage of the cyber attack and that it as a reference. In this way, attack detection and mitigation techniques developed against cyber attacks can be used more effectively, cyber attacks can be mapped, an in-depth report can be written and the details of the attack can be archived for a later use. Since this framework provides a clear roadmap of cyber attacks, researches can be conducted on other possible cyber attacks that have not yet occurred yet to develop ways to detect or avoid them.

In this part of the training, we have covered what MITRE is, what the MITRE ATT&CK Framework is and its importance of it for the SOC Analyst. We will cover the topic “**Matrix**” in the next chapter of our training.

### Matrix

## **What is MITRE ATT&CK Matrix?**

MITRE ATT&CK Matrix is a visualization method used to classify and see attack methods of cyber attackers. Matrices can be customized for almost any subject and turned into useful visuals. MITRE has created MITRE ATT&CK matrices to visualize the details of attacker behavior using the matrices.
## **Types of Matrices**

3 different matrices have been created within the MITRE ATT&CK Framework according to the platform types:

- Enterprise Matrix
- Mobile Matrix
- ICS (Industrial Control Systems) Matrix
- 
**Enterprise Matrix**

Enterprise matrix is the first matrix created by MITRE. There are more digital systems included in this matrix and are more common than those that are included in other matrices, so there are a lot more information in this matrix than other matrices. Enterprise matrix is mainly used to understand the cyber attacks on large organizations.

The following image shows the enterprise matrix in detail:

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/MITRE/3.Matrices/matrix1.png)

(Image Source: mitre.org)

There are 7 sub-matrices under the Enterprise Matrix:

- PRE
- Windows
- macOS
- Linux
- Cloud
- Network
- Containers

You can access the Enterprise Matrix and its sub-matrices at the following link and can learn more about them:

### Tactics

## **What is Tactic?**

Tactic expresses the purpose of the cyber attacker and the reason for his action. Tactics are one of the most important MITRE ATT&CK Framework components used to group cyber attacker behaviors and see the attack steps. Tactics are in the top row of the matrix.

As an example, the tactics on the enterprise matrix are shown in the image below:

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/MITRE/4.Tactics/tactic1.png)

(Image Source: mitre.org)   
## **Types of Tactics**

Tactics often consist of general statements as they express the purpose and reason for the cyber attack. Therefore, the tactics for each matrix are highly similar.

For example, the image below shows detailed information about the "Initial Access" tactic belonging to the enterprise matrix:

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/MITRE/4.Tactics/tactic2.png)

(Image Source: mitre.org)   

**Note:** Since the page in the above image has a long content, only the top part is shown.

In this part of the training, we have covered what the tactic is within the matrices as a  MITRE ATT&CK Framework component. We have also listed the tactics that are included in different matrices. In the next part of the training, we will cover the topic “**Techniques and Sub-Techniques**” within the matrices.

### Questions Progress

What is the ID of the "Lateral Movement" tactic in the Enterprise matrix?

When was the "Persistence" tactic in the mobile matrix created?  Answer Format: DD Month YYYY
  
What is the name of the tactic in Enterprise, Mobile and ICS matrices which is under the techniques related to obtaining higher-level permission on the target system/network?

---

### Techniques and Sub-Techniques

## **What are Techniques and Sub-Techniques?**

The tactics within the matrix only show what the attackers aim and do not contain detailed information about the attacker's attack method. The techniques and sub-techniques, on the other hand show the methods used by the attacker to achieve his goal and how he conducted the attack exactly. Each technique/sub-technique is included within the matrix depending on a particular tactic. As an example, some of the techniques on the enterprise matrix are shown in the image below:

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/MITRE/5.Techniques+and+Sub-Techniques/tech1.png)

(Image Source: mitre.org)

The majority of the areas in the matrix in the image above is techniques. Some techniques have sub-techniques and some do not.

As it is shown in the image above, If there are gray areas next to the boxes where the names of the techniques are written in the matrix, it indicates that the technique has a sub-technique. For example, let's see the sub-techniques of the first 4 techniques under the "Reconnaissance" tactic:
  
![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/MITRE/5.Techniques+and+Sub-Techniques/tech2.png)

(Image Source: mitre.org)
## **Types of Techniques and Sub-Techniques**

Techniques are divided into 3 groups according to matrices:

### Groups

Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) Groups, are the hacker groups that may include many different people and groups that carry out cyber attacks in a targeted and systematic way, with governments support from time to time. APT groups may conduct cyber attacks with different motivations. For example, the group may have a specific mission, may be conducting their attacks for money, or may be foreign government supported and conduct their attacks to obtain their national ideals.

Within the MITRE ATT&CK Framework, information about APT groups is collected which helps identify which APT group is targeting which systems and which cyber attack techniques are being implemented. When all this information is gathered together and evaluated with the MITRE ATT&CK matrix, the attack map of the APT group can be revealed.

**Groups**: 135

You can check the below link to see the updated number:

**Groups**: [https://attack.mitre.org/groups/](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/)
