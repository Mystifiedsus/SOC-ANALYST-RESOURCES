### Introduction to Incident Management

In this course; we will talk about how an incident that occurred within the organization is handled and how the investigation process should be carried out. While doing this, we will give examples from LetsDefend from time to time, and sometimes we will talk about the best practices.  
  
The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) defines a cyber incident as a breach of a system's security policy in order to affect its integrity or availability and/or the unauthorized access or attempted access to a system or systems; in line with the Computer Misuse Act.  
  
In our previous SIEM 101 training, we talked about how data is collected and converted into alerts within the SOC. If you have not completed that training yet, we recommend that you complete it by clicking the link and then continue from here. One of the platforms where alerts on SIEM are collected and investigated is the “Incident Management System”.  
  
In the continuation of this training, we will explain how an Incident Management System works, and why and how to use these systems as SOC analysts.

### Basic Definitions About Incident Management

In this section, we will explain the basic concepts that you need to know about incident management. Since you will encounter these concepts frequently during your education and your daily work routine, we recommend that you understand these concepts thoroughly:  
  
- Alert
- Event
- Incident
- True Positive
- False Positive
  
  
**Alert**  
  
We talked about how an alert is created in the SIEM training module. You can click on the link (https://app.letsdefend.io/training/lessons/siem-101) to access the training. To briefly recall, an alert is generated as a result of data collection and processing (parsing, enriching, etc.) in SIEM, as seen in the image below. Then, we start the analysis process by sending the generated alarms to the Incident Management System.  
  

![](https://letsdefend.io/images/training/IMS/2/siem-alert.PNG)

  
  
  
**Event**  
  
An event is any observable occurrence in a system or network. Simply, events are activities like a user connecting to a file share, a server receiving a request for a Web page, a user sending electronic mail (e-mail), a firewall blocking a connection attempt, etc.  
  
**Incident**  
  
The definition of a computer security incident has evolved over time. In the past, a computer security incident was thought of as a security-related adverse event in which there was a loss of data confidentiality, disruption of data or system integrity, or disruption or denial of availability.  
  
A lot of new types of computer security incidents have emerged since then, and this necessitated an expanded definition of “incident”. Generally, an incident is a violation or imminent threat of violation of computer security policies, acceptable use policies, or standard security practices. _Definitions: NIST Special Publication 800-61_  
  
**True Positive Alert**  
  
If the situation to be detected and the detected (triggered alert) situation are the same, it is a True Positive alert. For example, let's say you had a PCR test to find out whether you are Covid19 positive and the test result came back positive. It is True Positive because the condition you want to detect (whether you have Covid19 disease) and the detected condition (being a Covid19 patient) are the same. This is a true positive alert.  
  
Let’s suppose there is a rule to detect SQL Injection attacks and this rule has been triggered because of a request that was made to the following URL. The alert is indeed a “True Positive” as there was a real SQL Injection attack.  
  
https://app.letsdefend.io/casemanagement/casedetail/115/src=' OR 1=1  
  
**False Positive Alert**  
  
In short, it is a false alarm. For example, there is a security camera in your house and if the camera alerts you due to your cat's movements, it is a false positive alert.  
  
If we look at the URL example below, we see the SQL parameter "Union" keyword within this URL. If an SQL injection alert occurs for this URL, it will be a false positive alert because the “Union” keyword is used to mention a sports team here and not for an SQL injection attack.  
  
https://www.google.com/search?q=FC+Union+Berlin  
  
In order to better understand the definitions, you can compare the terms and definitions in a single table as follows:

### Incident Management Systems (IMS)

Incident Management Systems is where SOC teams conduct the investigation process and record the actions taken when an incident occurs. For this reason, SOC analysts spend a significant part of their time at the interface of these systems.  
  
An example of IMS is the open-source TheHive project.  
  
  

![hive dashboard](https://letsdefend.io/images/training/IMS/3/1-hive.PNG)

  
  
Similarly, "Case Management" on LetsDefend can be given as an example to the Incident Management Systems.  
  

![case management details](https://letsdefend.io/images/training/IMS/3/2-case-management.PNG)

  
  
**How Incident Management Systems (IMS) Works?**  
  
In order to open a record on the Incident Management platform, a data entry must first be provided here. This data can directly come from the SIEM or from other security products. After the data flow is established, a ticket/case is created on the Incident Management System.  
  
If integrations with “Threat Intelligence”, “SOAR”, and similar platforms are established data within the case is enriched and this helps in responding quickly. For example, let's say there is a suspicious "letsdefend.io" domain in the incident. If there is an integration between IMS and the threat intelligence platform, the reputation of the “letsdefend.io” domain address is automatically queried and provided to the SOC analyst. If there is not a threat intelligence platform integration, then a manual query from the open-source platforms such as Virustotal is required.  
  
In addition, SOAR products also offer integration with other security products. Many SOAR products can integrate with products such as Firewall, IPS, WAF, Proxy, Email Gateway, Email Security products. If we are sure that the domain “letsdefend.io” is harmful and we want to prevent access to this address from within the organization, we can quickly block this domain via a proxy with the help of SOAR.  
  
Consider the "Investigation Channel" on the LetsDefend Monitoring page. A new "Case" is created on the "Case Management" when we click the "Create Case" button here. In other words, a new record is created on the IMS.  
  

![siem create a case](https://letsdefend.io/images/training/IMS/3/3-monitoring.PNG)

  
  
Lastly, you can check the SIEM dashboard as a SOC analyst:  
  
[Start The Interactive Tour](https://app.letsdefend.io/monitoring?__ug__=41127)  
  
Generally, as we see in the picture below, alert details from SIEM are transmitted to the Incident Management System and the Incident Management System works in coordination with the Threat Intelligence and SOAR platforms to process all the data and a new case/ticket is created. Thanks to Threat Intelligence and SOAR integrations on IMS, data enrichment and various actions are provided. Finally, the alert is closed when the operations are complete.  
  

![incident management system details](https://letsdefend.io/images/training/IMS/3/4-ims-system.PNG)

  
  
**P.S.:** As we mentioned before, Incident Management System (IMS) is one of the platforms where you will spend most of your time as a SOC Analyst. You can significantly shorten your investigation time and get rid of your repetitive tasks if you use IMS platforms effectively. Therefore, you should always take your knowledge and skills on IMS platforms to the next level.

### Case/Alert Naming

It is important that the ticket/case/records created in the Incident management system have meaningful title as having unified naming conventions will help in the retrospective inquiries for quickly finding the relevant record or extracting statistics easily when an investigation is made. For these and similar reasons, it is necessary to have an idea about the ticket/case just by looking at the title. There are several methods for naming tickets. The naming method in LetsDefend "Case Management" is as follows.

EventID: {Alert ID Number} - [{Alert Name}]

  

![siem alert naming](https://letsdefend.io/images/training/IMS/4/alert-naming-siem.PNG)

  
Thanks to this naming convention, analysts can quickly access the alarm details they want to reach, by the alarm ID or Name, while examining the past records.  

![SOAR tickets](https://letsdefend.io/images/training/IMS/4/soar.PNG)

  
When we look at real-world examples, we see that the naming format we described above is a common practice in the industry. In addition, sometimes the following fields may be included in the title:  
  
- Alert Category
- Event Source
- Description
  
  
  
  

### Questions Progress

Correct

The case/ticket format in LetsDefend is as follows:  
  
EventID: {Alert ID Number} - [{Alert Name}]  
  
According to this information, how can the ticket be created for the alert with ID number 25 and rule name "SOC15 - Malware Detected" be named?

### Playbooks

There are many different types of alerts (web attacks, ransomware, malware, phishing, etc.) in the SOC environment. The methods and approaches of investigating these alerts are different from each other. The workflows prepared for effective and consistent analysis of alerts created on SIEM or a different security tool are called playbooks.  
  
For example, when you click the “Create Case” button for an alert on the LetsDefend Monitoring page, a ticket opens on “Case Management” and the system automatically assigns you a playbook. So you can investigate the alert with the right steps by following the instructions there.  
  
**Why is Playbook Important?**  
  
As SOC analysts, we may not always know exactly what to do when handling alerts. We can carry out the investigation process step by step, thanks to the instructions in the Playbook. Playbooks will provide guidance, especially to analysts who have just started their careers in the SOC field.  
  

![soc playbook](https://letsdefend.io/images/training/IMS/5/playbook.PNG)

  
  
We mentioned that playbooks guide analysts. Apart from that, it enables the team to perform analysis at certain standards. For instance, checking to see whether there is access to C2 sites/IP addresses is vital after analyzing malware. However, some analysts may not be checking to see the C2 access all the time, while others do. This leads to inconsistency in the team's work standards. It is important that playbooks are created and followed by all the analysts in order to ensure the same level of analysis standards within the team.  
  
In the example below, you can see the phishing playbook stream that Microsoft has published.

### What Does the SOC Analyst Do When An Alert Occurs?

In the previous sections, we talked about how an alert occurs. As a SOC Analyst, your main task is to detect threats to your organization. You usually do this task by analyzing the alerts created in SIEM or a different environment.  
  
The alerts that occur do not always indicate an actual incident. Sometimes you will encounter false positive alerts. In fact, you will spend most of your time dealing with the false positives, so you need to be in constant communication with the team that creates the SIEM rules and give them feedback all the time. As a SOC Analyst, you need to dig into the details to understand whether an alert is a false positive. There is no standard analysis method as there may be different types of alerts (web, malware, endpoint, etc), and each type has its own specific details. Therefore, it is important to follow the playbooks in the incident management systems.  
  
Let's give an example over LetsDefend for better understanding. As seen in the image below, there are many alerts on the "Monitoring" page. As analysts, we must decide and start by choosing an alert.  
  

![SIEM dashboard](https://letsdefend.io/images/training/IMS/6/siem.PNG)

  
  
Although it doesn't matter which alert you start within the simulation environment, in real life you need to prioritize the alerts with high severity values.  
  
You can start working on the alert you have chosen by clicking the “Take Ownership” button. The logic of the working standard is that there are 10 active alerts and you are working on the alert with EventID number 63. Since other team members know that you are working on this alert, they will choose one of the remaining 9 alerts and continue working. Thus, teamwork is ensured to avoid duplicate work.  
  

![take ownership of alert](https://letsdefend.io/images/training/IMS/6/2-take-ownership.PNG)

  
  
P.S.: You work on LetsDefend individually, not as a member of a team.  
  
After taking ownership of the alert, you will see that the alert has been forwarded to the "Investigation Channel". This channel has alerts that are actively being worked on. Click on the alert for details. Our goal is to determine if this alert actually contains a harmful situation. In other words, we need to determine whether it is a false positive or true positive. For this, we can create a record on “Case Management/Incident Management” by clicking the “Create Case” button and then following the playbook steps.  
  

![create a ticket soar](https://letsdefend.io/images/training/IMS/6/3-create-case.PNG)

  
  
Playbook offers you the steps to follow. After closing the alert, it helps you to check your analysis results through some questions.  
  

![SOC Analyst playbook](https://letsdefend.io/images/training/IMS/6/4-playbook.PNG)

  
  
After completing the Playbook steps, you will be redirected to the Monitoring page again. Now that you are done with the analysis, you now need to make a final decision. Is this alert a false positive or a true positive?  
  

![close siem alert](https://letsdefend.io/images/training/IMS/6/5-close-alert.PNG)

  
  
After making the necessary selections and explanations, you can close the alert and view your analysis results.  
  
P.S.: In real life, you may not be able to verify your analysis results all the time. Sometimes you can work with a senior analyst and get help by explaining the steps you have done, but this is not a sustainable method. Therefore, it is an opportunity to examine the analysis results of the alerts you have closed in LetsDefend and to learn new methods.  
  
After the alert is closed, it will be directed to the "Closed Alerts" channel and you will be able to check your answers here.
