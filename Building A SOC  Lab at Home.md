Check the NetBIOS domain name. 

Leave the default path.

Launch the install.

Reboot when asked for it.

  

## Configuration of Active Directory

Now you have the Active Directory Server, you need to populate it with misconfiguration to perform analysis. We will use [BadBlood](https://github.com/davidprowe/BadBlood) for this task, Please follow the instructions below:

-Download it on the AD

-Extract it

-Launch Powershell as administrator

-Go to Badblood folder

-Launch Invoke-BadBlood.ps1

-Let the magic happen (this can take several minutes)
